**Deployment diagram**

A deployment diagram allows you to illustrate how containers in the static model are mapped to infrastructure. This deployment diagram is based upon a UML deployment diagram, although simplified slightly to show the mapping between containers and deployment nodes. A deployment node is something like physical infrastructure (e.g. a physical server or device), virtualised infrastructure (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, a virtual machine), containerised infrastructure (e.g. a Docker container), an execution environment (e.g. a database server, Java EE web/application server, Microsoft IIS), etc. Deployment nodes can be nested.

**Scope**: A single software system.

**Primary elements**: Deployment nodes and containers within the software system in scope.

**Intended audience**: Technical people inside and outside of the software development team; including software architects, developers and operations/support staff.
